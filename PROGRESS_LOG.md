## 📋 Detailed Step Log

### ✅ Step 1: Folder Scanner + JSON Cache
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Deliverables:**
- Recursive folder scanner supporting MP3, FLAC, M4A, WAV, OGG
- Per-format metadata reader normalized into one `Track` model (title,
  artists, album, album artists, year, genre, disc number, track
  number, embedded-art detection), despite each format storing tags
  completely differently under the hood (ID3 vs Vorbis comments vs MP4
  atoms)
- Multi-artist splitting using configurable separators, including the
  fix for Windows-style multi-value artist tag lists (e.g.
  `["Travis Scott", "Future", "2 Chainz"]`) instead of only reading the
  first entry
- JSON cache with **atomic writes** (temp file + `os.replace`, so a
  crash mid-save can't corrupt the library)
- Dedup by file path on re-scan (never creates duplicate entries)
- Missing-file detection — a file deleted/moved outside the app gets
  flagged `file_missing: true` instead of crashing the scanner, and
  un-flags itself if the file reappears
- `step1_demo.py` console script + `generate_test_files.py` (creates 8
  real tagged audio files across all 5 formats for testing)

### ✅ Step 2: Main Window UI (Tracks/Artists/Albums/Playlists)
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Deliverables:**
- Real PyQt6 application window (`main.py`) — Main/Menu screen with top
  bar (Settings + Search), four tabs, and an always-visible bottom
  mini-player bar
- `LibraryStore`: Qt-signal observer layer over the JSON cache. Every
  view subscribes to its signals (`tracks_added`, `track_updated`,
  `track_removed`, etc.) so the UI updates live with **no manual
  refresh and no app restart** — verified by removing a track and
  confirming Tracks, Albums, and Artists views all updated automatically
- Tracks tab: sortable table (Title/Artist(s)/Album/Duration, default
  A-Z), Play All + Shuffle buttons, right-click menu (Edit Metadata /
  Remove Song / Add to Playlist — Remove Song fully functional, the
  other two correctly say which later step builds them)
- Artists tab: Artist Name + Track Count (counts every track an artist
  contributed to, lead or featured)
- Albums tab: Album Name, Artists, total Duration, Year — grouped by
  album name + primary album artist so same-named albums by different
  artists don't merge
- Playlists tab: correct empty state (full management is Step 7)
- Settings dialog: Add/Remove music folders (triggers a real background
  scan with a progress dialog), separator management
- Threaded scanning on a background `QThread` so the UI never freezes,
  even on very large libraries
- Missing-file rows render in red in the Tracks list; clicking one
  shows the correct warning instead of crashing
- `QAbstractTableModel`/`QAbstractListModel`-backed views throughout
  (not one widget per row), so the UI stays fast regardless of library
  size
- A deliberate dark theme (`ui/theme.py`) rather than default Qt styling
- **Bugfix:** "Open Settings" button in the empty state now opens
  Settings — wired to the exact same method as the ⚙ gear icon
- **Redesign:** separator configuration is now a full list with
  checkboxes (enable/disable without losing the separator), add via
  input+button/Enter, edit (✎) and remove (✕) for custom separators;
  default separators can be disabled but not deleted
- `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` added to track requested features against the
  step they naturally belong to
- **Theme Selector**: Settings now has a theme dropdown (Dark, Light,
  Midnight Blue, Warm Amber) that re-applies the global stylesheet
  immediately and persists across restarts — see "Cross-Cutting
  Additions" below for details
- **Planned follow-up (not yet built):** a Genres tab will be added
  alongside Tracks/Artists/Albums/Playlists, following the same
  Artists-tab pattern — see `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` item #22. Logged here
  rather than under Step 5+ since it reuses Step 2's existing tab
  infrastructure directly and doesn't depend on later steps.

### ✅ Step 3: Audio Playback Engine
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Deliverables:**
- `PlaybackEngine` (`core/playback_engine.py`) built on `QMediaPlayer`/
  `QAudioOutput`: play, pause, stop, seek, smart Previous (restarts the
  current track unless within the first ~3 seconds, in which case it
  goes to the actual previous track — `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` item #18),
  Next
- **Gapless playback** (`FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` item #15): two
  `QMediaPlayer`/`QAudioOutput` pairs are kept at all times (active +
  silent standby preloaded with whatever plays next); handoff happens
  at 95% of the active track's duration with no audible gap. Volume and
  output device are kept in sync across both players so the handoff
  never causes a volume jump or device reversion.
- **Queue management**, exactly per the specified logic: the queue is
  unique by track path (no duplicates ever). "Play Next" moves an
  already-queued track to right after the current one rather than
  duplicating it; "Add to Queue" moves it to the end. Play All replaces
  the queue entirely, never appends. Verified with a test that
  specifically exercises "play_next/add_to_queue on the
  currently-playing track itself" — this caught and fixed a real bug
  where the current-track index could desync after such a move.
- Repeat modes (off/all/one) and shuffle, both tested for correct
  behavior at queue boundaries (stop vs. wrap vs. stay)
- **Continuous (~1s) position persistence** plus exact-position saves
  on every pause/stop, so a restart resumes within ~1 second of where
  playback last was — verified via a real simulated-restart test (one
  engine instance saves, a second fresh instance reloads the same cache
  and restores track + position correctly, paused not auto-playing)
- **Volume control**: per-app playback volume (not OS master volume —
  see the decision below), persisted across restarts via a new
  `PlayerState.volume` field
- **Output device selector**: `QMediaDevices`/`QAudioDevice`
  enumeration and selection, also persisted across restarts via a new
  `PlayerState.output_device_id` field (falls back silently to the
  system default if a previously-selected device is no longer present
  — e.g. headphones unplugged — rather than erroring)
- `VolumeOutputControl` widget (`ui/widgets/volume_output_control.py`):
  volume slider + output device dropdown, fully wired to the real
  engine (tested end-to-end: dragging the actual slider updates the
  actual engine and persists to disk) but deliberately not placed in
  any layout yet — per spec these controls belong on the Player Screen
  (Step 4), not the Main Menu, so it's built and ready for Step 4 to
  simply place rather than build from scratch
- Bottom bar (from Step 2) is now fully functional: Play/Pause/Next/
  Previous buttons drive real playback, a thin progress strip along the
  top edge reflects real position, and the play/pause icon reflects
  real state
- **Volume control scope decision:** the original ask described
  system/master volume via `QAudioDevice`. That's not something Qt's
  audio APIs can do — see `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` item #12 for the full
  explanation. Built as standard per-app playback volume (how every
  media player's volume slider actually works), confirmed with the
  person before building.
- **Playback engine library decision:** `QMediaPlayer` (PyQt6.QtMultimedia),
  confirmed by directly testing it against all 8 test files across all 5
  supported formats in this sandbox — all loaded with correct duration
  and zero errors, on Qt's modern FFmpeg-based multimedia backend (not
  the older GStreamer backend responsible for most of `QMediaPlayer`'s
  negative reputation online).
- **Decision: raw `.aac` (bare ADTS stream, no container) will NOT be
  supported** (decided 2026-06-28, after briefly being implemented and
  then explicitly reverted at the person's request). It does play
  correctly via `QMediaPlayer`/mutagen, but its duration can only be
  estimated from bitrate (confirmed via direct testing — FFmpeg itself
  logs "Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate" for
  these files) and it carries no metadata tags at all (no container to
  store them). Supported formats remain exactly: `.mp3`, `.flac`,
  `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.ogg`. (Note: `.m4a` is unaffected by this decision —
  it's AAC audio inside a proper MP4 container, which has a real
  duration index and tag storage, unlike bare `.aac`.) May be revisited
  in a future version per the person's note.

### ✅ Step 4: Player Screen
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-06-30
**Deliverables:**
- Slides up from the bottom bar when clicked, slides down when back button is pressed.
- Displays large beautiful album art, track title, artists, seek bar, and fully functional transport controls.
- Heart button moved dynamically to be centered right under the play/back/next transport controls (inside the bottom toggles layout, between lyrics and queue buttons).
- Updated the heart icon to render filled red when favorited (checked) and outlined when unchecked, ensuring seamless visual feedback.
- Implemented a complete volume control system directly in the player screen, placing a horizontal volume slider and toggleable speaker/mute button in the bottom right. When the volume slider is changed, the engine's playback volume is updated, and when volume is 0, the mute icon appears. Speaker and mute toggle with each other to restore the previous non-zero volume.
- Standardized the speaker and mute button icons (`Speaker_Icon.svg`, `Mute.svg`) to use standard `fill="currentColor" stroke="none"` vectors. Updated the player screen mute logic to draw the speaker/mute icon in `text_primary` instead of `text_secondary` in all states, ensuring the speaker button has the exact same visual weight and theme-adaptive color as the main play/pause transport controls across all 4 themes.
- Added a symmetrical layout spacer on the left side of the player screen bottom toggles bar to keep the core buttons (lyrics, heart, queue, headphones) perfectly mathematically centered on any screen size.
- Fully wired the player screen next/prev button hold timeouts so they correctly transition to seek/scrub states and do not accidentally trigger single-click next/previous track skips upon mouse release.
- Integrated a headphone icon on the right side of the queue button to list and change available audio devices via an elegant, theme-aware popup context menu, without opening any secondary window.
- SVG icons render beautifully and adapt dynamically to all 4 app themes (Dark, Light, Midnight Blue, Warm Amber) by replacing hardcoded fills and automatically scaling icon overlays (e.g., slashes for repeat/shuffle off, "1" indicator for repeat-one) based on custom viewBox sizes (32x32 vs 24x24).
- Corrected shuffle behavior to avoid skipping or jumping to a random song when turning shuffle ON or OFF, keeping the active track seamlessly playing in its current queue position.
- Added dynamic mouse hover event tracking in `clickable_label.py` to elegantly underline and highlight artist/album text on hover, matching native hyperlink feedback.
- Properly wired the table row click signals (`artist_requested` and `album_requested`) from the `TracksView` to `MainWindow`'s stub navigation routes, ensuring clean interaction paths for when those full pages are built.
- **Verified Status of Album Cover Row States:** Confirmed that the "Album cover displayed on the left side of track name in the menu/track list" feature (with State A, State B, State C for playing, paused-hover, and paused-no-hover) is currently **NOT** completed in Steps 1 to 4. The `TrackHoverDelegate` title column currently delegates to standard text rendering, so this feature has been documented and updated as a high-priority item in `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` (Item #4) to be implemented in a future step.

### ✅ Step 5: Album Page + Artist Page + Genre Page
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Deliverables:**
- **ArtistPageView:** A comprehensive, beautiful dedicated artist page that displays artist stats (track counts), a list of albums they are the main artist of, an "Appears On" section for guest/contributor tracks, and a full track table.
- **AlbumPageView:** A beautiful dedicated album page displaying a large album cover, release year, duration stats, and album artists (clickable buttons). The tracks are automatically grouped by disc number, rendering separate tables for multi-disc releases. The first column displays the track number, which morphs into a play overlay button on hover and an animated equalizer during playback.
- **GenrePageView:** A dynamic genre page showing tracks in that genre along with count stats, and supporting instant "Play Genre" and "Shuffle" operations.
- **Genres Tab (GenresView):** Implemented a complete Genres list tab (Name, track count) sorted alphabetically, matching the design of the Artists/Albums tabs. Double-clicking any genre row immediately loads the dedicated Genre Page.
- **Dynamic Tab Titles & Management:** Dynamically-created page tabs are labeled elegantly as `Name | Type` (e.g. `Travis Scott | Artist`, `Rodeo | Album`, `Pop | Genre`).
- **Tab Closability:** Dynamic page tabs are closable (via an elegant "X" close button), while permanent core tabs (Tracks, Artists, Genres, Albums, Playlists) are locked and cannot be closed.
- **Auto-Refresh Integration:** Connected all dynamic page views to the `LibraryStore` metadata signals (`tracks_added`, `track_removed`, `track_updated`) to ensure page content live-updates if files are added, modified, or removed.

### ✅ Step 6: Metadata Editing
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Deliverables:**
- **Robust Tag Writer Engine:** Created `core/metadata_writer.py` to write metadata changes back to original audio files across all 5 supported formats (MP3/FLAC/M4A/WAV/OGG) utilizing `mutagen` safely and robustly.
- **Modern Tag Chip/Tagging Widget:** Implemented a customizable `TagInputField` that renders beautiful tag chip boxes with a light surface background and "✕" close buttons. Features instant, real-time split-on-comma (`,`), split-on-enter, and split-on-focus-out behaviors.
- **Fully-Featured Metadata Editor Dialog:** Implemented a modern `MetadataEditorDialog` UI displaying:
  - Interactive **Album Cover Image** uploader (allows browsing and selecting a `.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg` file).
  - Text input for **Track Name** and **Album Name**.
  - Advanced chip editors for **Artist(s)**, **Album Artist(s)**, and **Genre(s)**.
  - Release year field and formatted **Disc & Track Numbers** accompanied by the **Disc SVG** icon and **"#" (hashtag)** icon.
- **Unsaved Changes Confirmation Safeguard:** Configured dialog `closeEvent` and button handlers to check if any field has been modified. Displays an intuitive "Are you sure? Changes will be lost" confirmation popup when closing with unsaved edits, and closes directly when clean.
- **Instant Live App-Wide Refresh:** Connected the Save action directly to the single source of truth `LibraryStore.update_track()`. Updates propagate instantly and seamlessly across all visible tables, stats, and dynamic pages (such as Album/Artist/Genre page views) with zero app freezes or restarts.

### 🔜 Step 7: Playlists
**Status:** Planned
**Deliverables:**
- [Placeholder — create/rename/delete playlists, add/remove tracks,
  drag-and-drop reordering, cover image picker]

### ✅ Step 8: Queue Panel + Lyrics Panel
**Status:** Done
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Deliverables:**
- **High-Fidelity QueuePanel:** Created a slide-in side panel from the right that displays the active queue tracks. Shows Title, Artist, and Duration metadata from `LibraryStore` for all tracks.
- **Dynamic Track Highlights:** Highlighted the currently playing track with an accent-colored play indicator ("▶") and bold text, syncing instantly with the playback engine.
- **Queue Modification Context Menu:** Added a custom-styled, theme-aware right-click context menu offering "Play Now" and "Remove" actions, plus keyboard support for deleting rows via the `Delete` key.
- **Automatic Drag & Drop Sync:** Implemented a custom `QueueListWidget` that supports drag-and-drop row reordering, automatically syncing the new order with the `PlaybackEngine.reorder_queue()` handler.
- **Queue Close Controls & Drag Resizing:** Replaced the "Clear" button and "✕" with a flat "<" (less-than) symbol to slide-close the panel smoothly. Added mouse-drag horizontal resizing with strict min (260px) and max (450px) width clamps.
- **Album Covers & Three Visual States in Queue:** Displays the track's album cover on the left side of each queue row (32x32 px with a 4px rounded border) with three dynamic visual states: State A (pulsing equalizer animation when playing), State B (play overlay when paused + hovered), and State C (static cover when paused).
- **Themed, Fluid LyricsPanel:** Designed a premium scroll-centered lyrics display supporting external `.lrc`, `.txt`, and embedded audio tags (`USLT` for MP3, `LYRICS` for FLAC, `©lyr` for M4A/MP4).
- **Lyrics Panel Centering:** Positioned the lyrics panel perfectly centered in the screen viewport, maintaining a small gap from the top bar and a small gap above the track details area.
- **LRC Multi-Line Parsing Fix:** Fixed parser bug to group lines sharing identical timestamps, allowing multiple lines to display and highlight concurrently on screen.
- **Smooth Auto-Scroll Karaoke Highlights:** Implemented high-contrast karaoke highlighting on the current line and zero-flicker, easing-curve vertical scrollbar animations to keep the active lyric line centered.
- **Manual Scroll Recovery & Sync:** Created wheel and scroll track detectors: if a user scrolls away to read, an elegant floating "Sync" button slides in, instantly returning the viewport to the current line when clicked.
- **Built-in Offline Lyrics Editor:** Constructed a `LyricsEditorDialog` with a full-height code-style layout. Users can write, paste, or format synchronized or unsynced lyrics, saving changes back to disk directly as `.lrc` or `.txt` next to the track.
- **Album Tab Genre Hover & Navigation Fix:** Enabled proper underline hovers, hand cursor styling, and instant dynamic tab navigation for track genres displayed in the Album tab track table.

### 🔜 Step 9: Settings Polish + Search
**Status:** Planned
**Deliverables:**
- [Placeholder — live search across Tracks/Artists/Albums/Playlists/
  Genres (search matches genre names too, filtering the Genres tab the
  same way it filters the others — see `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` item #22),
  search bar moved directly into the top bar replacing the standalone
  🔍 button; app header branding (logo from `assets/logo.png` + title,
  already showing "AuraPlayer" as text) and the animated sliding
  active-tab indicator — see `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` item #21; new View
  menu with show/hide checkboxes for each tab including Genres (this is
  a new menu, nothing like it exists yet)]

### 🔜 Step 10: Packaging
**Status:** Planned
**Deliverables:**
- [Placeholder — installation instructions, finalized `requirements.txt`,
  possible PyInstaller `.exe` build]

## 🎨 Cross-Cutting Additions

- **Project renamed to "AuraPlayer"** (2026-06-28): updated in the
  window title, the Main Menu top-bar header, and this log's own title
  plus `README.md`'s header. No code module names changed (the project
  folder, internal class names, etc. were never named after the old
  "Music Player" title to begin with, so this was a low-risk, contained
  rename).
- **Theme Selector** (requested 2026-06-28, delivered 2026-06-28): ✅ Done.
  Settings now has a theme dropdown — Dark (default), Light, Midnight
  Blue, Warm Amber. Switching applies the new stylesheet to the whole
  app immediately (no restart), and the choice persists across
  restarts. Building this surfaced two real theme-coverage bugs (the
  bottom-bar album-art placeholder and two hint labels had hardcoded
  dark-theme colors baked in) which are now fixed so all 4 themes are
  fully consistent everywhere in the app, not just in the main color
  areas.
- **Top bar layout change** (requested 2026-06-28, scheduled for Step 8):
  the Main Menu top bar (currently `[Settings ⚙]` on the right with
  Search 🔍 next to it, from Step 2) will gain a 📋 Queue button
  positioned between them: `[⚙] [📋] [🔍]`. Noted here now so the
  change doesn't surprise anyone comparing Step 8's top bar to Step 2's
  screenshots — the underlying `TopBar` widget gets a new button added,
  not rebuilt from scratch.
- See `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` for the full list of 11 additional features
  requested during Step 2 review (tab titles, full right-click menu,
  hover states, smart playlists, drag & drop, favorites, export, etc.)
  and which step each is scheduled for.

- **Album Cover with Playback States in Tracks List** (completed 2026-07-01): ✅ Done.
  Implemented album art display in the track list within `TrackHoverDelegate` for the Title column.
  - Displays the embedded album art (from metadata) or a beautifully stylized theme-adaptive fallback placeholder.
  - Implements the three requested states:
    - **State A - Current song is PLAYING:** Show active 3-bar animated equalizer, and dim the cover.
    - **State B - Current song is PAUSED + Cursor HOVER:** Show a play overlay icon (▶), and dim the cover.
    - **State C - Current song is PAUSED + No Hover:** Show the album cover at normal brightness.
  - Added a dynamic repaint loop driven by an animation timer when tracks are active, making the equalizer visually pulse smoothly like a professional audio visualizer.

- **Unified Vector Disc Placeholders (No Emojis)** (completed 2026-07-05): ✅ Done.
  Completely cleaned and modernized the default album cover and track placeholders across the entire application:
  - Replaced all raw text/emoji fallback placeholders (like "♪" and "🎵") with a high-fidelity vector `disc.svg` via `svg_pixmap("disc", ...)`.
  - The vector placeholder renders dynamically with theme-adaptive colors based on the active style (e.g. `text_secondary` or custom panel highlights).
  - Applied this clean aesthetic uniformly to the **Tracks Table**, **Albums Grid**, **Album Page**, **Artist Page**, **Play Queue Side Panel**, **Bottom Mini-Player Bar**, **Full Player Screen**, and the **Album & Metadata Editor Dialogs**.
  - Updated the bottom bar view's default layout when no track is selected or playing to seamlessly show the styled vector disc fallback in the correct theme color.
